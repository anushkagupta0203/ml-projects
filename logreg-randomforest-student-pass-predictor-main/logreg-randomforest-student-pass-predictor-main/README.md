# 🎓 Student Pass/Fail Prediction

This project builds a classification model to predict whether a student will **pass or fail** based on key academic and demographic features.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

The goal is to classify student outcomes based on the following input features:

- Gender  
- Race/Ethnicity  
- Parental Level of Education  
- Lunch Type  
- Test Preparation Course  
- Math Score  
- Reading Score  
- Writing Score  

---

## 🧠 Models Used

- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data handling
- **Scikit-learn** – Modeling & evaluation (`LogisticRegression`, `RandomForestClassifier`, `train_test_split`, `metrics`)
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – Data visualization & EDA

---

## 🧪 Workflow Summary

1. **Data Collection** – Used a dataset on student performance  
2. **Preprocessing** – Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualized patterns and correlations  
4. **Model Building** – Trained both Logistic Regression and Random Forest  
5. **Evaluation** – Compared models using performance metrics  
6. **Conclusion** – Selected the best-performing model based on results

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy Score**  
- **Confusion Matrix**  
- **Precision / Recall / F1-Score**  
- **ROC-AUC Score** *(if applicable)*
